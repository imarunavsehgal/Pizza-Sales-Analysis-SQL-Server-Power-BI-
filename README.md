## Pizza-Sales-Analysis-SQL-Server-Power-BI-

This project presents an end-to-end pizza sales performance analysis using Microsoft SQL Server and Power BI to derive business insights from raw transactional data. The dataset was first imported into SQL Server, where SQL queries were executed in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to clean, transform, and aggregate the data. Key performance indicators such as Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas per Order were calculated using SQL. The processed data was then connected to Power BI to build interactive dashboards and visualizations, including daily and monthly sales trends, category-wise sales distribution, size preferences, and product performance analysis. Charts such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, and funnel charts were used to identify top-selling pizzas, underperforming products, and customer behavior patterns. This project demonstrates strong SQL querying skills, KPI analysis, and business intelligence dashboarding, reflecting a real-world data analyst workflow.

# Problem Statement
To analyze pizza sales data to understand business performance, customer ordering behavior, and product trends using KPI metrics and data visualizations.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following metrics were calculated using SQL:
1.Total Revenue – Sum of total price of all pizza orders. 
2.Average Order Value – Total revenue divided by total number of orders.
3.Total Pizzas Sold – Total quantity of pizzas sold.
4.Total Orders – Count of total orders placed.
5. Average Pizzas per Order – Total pizzas sold divided by total orders.

# Visual Analysis Performed

The following dashboards and charts were created in Power BI:
1.Daily Trend for Total Orders (Bar Chart).
2. Monthly/Hourly Trend for Total Orders (Line Chart).
3. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category (Pie Chart).
4. Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size (Pie Chart).
5. Total Pizzas Sold by Category (Funnel Chart).
6. Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Quantity & Orders (Bar Chart).
7. Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Revenue, Quantity & Orders (Bar Chart).
